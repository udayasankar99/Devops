What is SonarQube? 
Quality management tool(code and test quality)
	1. Code quality
	2. Test Quality


Note: You can add different SCA tools to Sonar by adding plugins, so the no of rules will be increased


How to get quality reports of the code?
	Code Quality:
	- Peers code review
	- Static Code review - COde would review code(Rules) --> This is done through SCA (Static Code Analysis)tool

	Test Quality:
		Test Reports
		Code Coverage Reports


SCA Tool -- Generate Reports but there are lot many tool available specific to a program language. 

Report contains:
	What is the issue
	Who made it
	When it was introduced
	How to fix it
	Where is that line?

Why do we need Sonarcube??
Suppose in your organisation many developers would be there say one java, developers, python, each one would use different SCA tools and so many reports will be generated daily.

So it will be tough task to maintain so many tools and keep track of the report and rules

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sonarcube is developed using java. We need JRE11

Sonarcube Architecture

Scanner--> Source Code --> Reports --> Server

Scanner Agent runs on source code -->  downloads rules from server and apply on code --> generates reports --> upload report to database on server which makes it available on dashboard

Scanner Agent is a jar file, which oyu run using jenkins, maven gradle etc

 

Server:
	Dashboard
		Rules
		Projects
		Issues
		Quality Profile
		Gate
		Admin
	Backend Support
		MSSQL
		Postgre
		Oracle


SOurce Code :
	It will be having a property file which will be created automatically by jenkins or maven. Or you need to create it manually

HOw to run scanner??

Go to the source code folder and run the executable of scanner.


Quality Profiles:
Here you can define your own profile with rules. After that go the source code property file and change sonar.profile propert

Quality Gates:
It is set of conditions set by product owner or client like if no of bugs are more than 5 then i wont accept, if no of duplicate lines are moe than 10 then wont accept. In that case snarqube fails it  


Used to run static code analysis

Plugin used:
Sonarcube server
Sonarcube scanner

SOnar Cube COnfigs:

SOnarqube 6 - JDK 8
SOnarqube 7 - JDK 11
Non root user must be there to start a sonaqube server
